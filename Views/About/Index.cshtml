            <p>Founded in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche, Porsche initially offered motor vehicle development work and consulting but did not build any cars under its own name. The first Porsche-branded vehicle, the Porsche 356, was produced in 1948. It was a lightweight and nimble sports car based on Volkswagen components.</p>
